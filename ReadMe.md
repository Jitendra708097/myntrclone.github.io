Vite parcel is easy to use .

write command to install vite in our project (npm create vite@latest).

for node modules we write command (npm install).

After run this vite project (npm run dev);

If we enter new company we first pacakge.json file which in all is store about project.
after that open script 
for run write (npm run...)

for production ready code write (npm run build).


If we want to that my parcel code does enter in production ready code.
We want as a devdependencies then run command (npm install -D parcel).

In JSX {} we can write inside curly braces only java script expression not statement.

The first letter of JSX component or function name should be capital.  call jSX function like that <Function name/>

In react there is rule for function.
